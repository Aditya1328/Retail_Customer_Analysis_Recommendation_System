# Retail_Customer_Analysis_Recommendation_System

## üìò Project Owerview
This project focuses on analyzing retail customer purchase behavior, segmenting customers using clustering techniques, and generating personalized product recommendations. The dataset used comes from a real-world retail transaction log and contains information about invoices, products, and customer purchases.

## üîÅ Key Processes
1. Data Cleaning

Removed null and duplicate values

Filtered out negative or invalid quantities and prices

Created a clean, structured dataset suitable for modeling

2. Feature Engineering

Derived RFM features: Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value

Created customer-level aggregated data

Additional features like total products purchased, average basket size

3. Outlier Detection

Applied Isolation Forest algorithm to detect abnormal customer behavior

Filtered out outliers to improve clustering accuracy

4. Dimensionallity Reduction

Performing Dimensionallity reduction with Principal Component Analysis(PCA) by reducing columns to identify most important features.

5.Customer Segmentation

Used KMeans clustering based on normalized RFM features

Determined optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score

Visualized distributions of key features (spending, frequency, quantity) across clusters through histograms.

Based on visuallization, drawing out observations.

6. Best-Selling Product Analysis

Aggregated purchase data per cluster.

Identified top 10 best-selling products for each cluster.

7. Product Recommendation System

For each customer, recommended 3 products from their cluster‚Äôs top-selling list that they haven't purchased.

Personalized, cluster-aware suggestions.
